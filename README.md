This C++ code reads data from a text file containing information gathered from a census regarding the education level of participants.
The code then uses the data to calculate percentages of the education level and genders. 
The program then scores the overall level of education from the participant sample.

This program is composed by a main file, and 2 classes, each with their cpp and hpp files. 
This repository includes 10 different "info" or database files that can be used to test the code.
